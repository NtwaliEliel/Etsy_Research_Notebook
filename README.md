## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

The rapid growth of e-commerce platforms has created unprecedented opportunities for small businesses and individual entrepreneurs. Etsy, as a leading marketplace for handmade, vintage, and craft supplies, hosts millions of sellers worldwide. However, the platform exhibits significant performance disparities among shops, with a small percentage of sellers achieving remarkable success while many struggle to gain traction. Understanding the factors that contribute to shop success and developing predictive capabilities can provide valuable insights for both platform operators and individual sellers.

Previous research in e-commerce success prediction has primarily focused on large-scale retail platforms like Amazon and eBay [1], with limited attention to creative marketplaces like Etsy. The unique characteristics of Etsy—emphasizing handmade goods, personal branding, and community engagement—warrant specialized investigation. This study addresses this gap by developing and comparing multiple machine learning approaches specifically tailored to the Etsy ecosystem.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The core research question addressed in this study is: **Can machine learning and deep learning models effectively predict which Etsy shops will achieve top-quartile sales performance based on their operational characteristics and early performance metrics?**

This investigation has both theoretical and practical significance. Theoretically, it contributes to the understanding of success factors in creative marketplaces. Practically, it enables the development of early warning systems for at-risk shops and success prediction tools for promising ventures.

### 1.3 Research Objectives

The specific objectives of this research are:

1. To preprocess and engineer relevant features from raw Etsy shop data
2. To implement and compare multiple traditional machine learning models
3. To design and train deep learning architectures using both Sequential and Functional APIs
4. To conduct systematic experiments with hyperparameter optimization
5. To evaluate model performance using comprehensive metrics and visualizations
6. To identify key success factors through feature importance analysis

### 1.4 Report Structure

The methodology details data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model implementation. Results are presented through comparative tables and visualizations, followed by critical analysis of findings and their implications.

## 2 Literature Review

### 2.1 E-commerce Success Prediction

The prediction of business success in online marketplaces has emerged as a significant research stream in recent years. Chen et al. [2] demonstrated that early performance metrics strongly correlate with long-term success in online marketplaces, with seller ratings and review patterns serving as reliable indicators. Their study of Amazon marketplace data revealed that the first three months of operation are particularly predictive of long-term outcomes.

Zhang and Zhou [3] extended this work by examining feature importance across different e-commerce platforms. They found that while certain metrics like customer ratings showed consistent importance across platforms, platform-specific features often carried significant predictive power. This underscores the importance of domain-specific modeling approaches.

### 2.2 Machine Learning in Business Analytics

Traditional machine learning approaches have shown considerable success in business prediction tasks. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms have consistently demonstrated strong performance in classification tasks involving tabular data [4]. These ensemble methods excel at capturing complex feature interactions while maintaining robustness to noise and outliers.

Logistic regression remains valuable for its interpretability and statistical foundations, particularly in contexts where understanding feature relationships is as important as prediction accuracy [5]. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have shown particular strength in high-dimensional spaces and cases where class separation is complex but clear [6].

### 2.3 Deep Learning Applications

Deep learning approaches have revolutionized pattern recognition across numerous domains. In business analytics, neural networks have demonstrated superior performance in capturing complex nonlinear relationships that may elude traditional methods [7]. The Sequential API in TensorFlow provides an intuitive framework for building layered architectures, while the Functional API enables more complex model designs with multiple input branches and shared layers.

Kim et al. [8] demonstrated that deep learning models can effectively identify subtle patterns in business data that correlate with success outcomes. Their work highlighted the importance of architectural choices and regularization strategies in preventing overfitting while maintaining model capacity.

### 2.4 Methodological Considerations

Proper model evaluation requires comprehensive metrics beyond simple accuracy. ROC curves and AUC scores provide robust evaluation of classification performance across different threshold settings [9]. Learning curves offer insights into model training dynamics and potential overfitting, while confusion matrices enable detailed error analysis [10].

Hyperparameter optimization through systematic search methods like GridSearchCV has been shown to significantly improve model performance while providing insights into parameter sensitivity [11]. Cross-validation ensures robust performance estimation and reduces the risk of overfitting to specific data splits.

### 2.5 Research Gap

While substantial research exists on e-commerce prediction generally, limited work has focused specifically on creative marketplaces like Etsy. The unique combination of artistic production, personal branding, and community engagement in these platforms may require specialized modeling approaches. This study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparison of multiple machine learning approaches specifically for Etsy shop success prediction.

## 3 Methodology

### 3.1 Data Collection and Description

The study utilized a comprehensive dataset of 10,000 Etsy shops collected on April 3, 2022. The dataset includes diverse features spanning performance metrics, business policies, geographic information, and temporal characteristics. Table 1 summarizes the key variables available in the dataset.

**Table 1: Dataset Variables Overview**
| Category | Variables | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|

Missing numeric values were imputed using median values to preserve distribution characteristics while handling missingness. Categorical variables with missing values were assigned to an "Unknown" category to preserve information while maintaining data integrity.

#### 3.2.2 Feature Engineering
Several derived features were created to capture meaningful business relationships:

- **Sales per Listing**: `sold_count / (active_listing_count + 1)`
- **Favorites per Listing**: `favorites_count / (active_listing_count + 1)`
- **Rating to Sales Ratio**: `(average_rating × total_rating_count) / (sold_count + 1)`
- **US-Based Indicator**: Binary flag for United States location
- **Shop Age**: Days since shop creation

#### 3.2.3 Outlier Treatment
Extreme values beyond the 1st and 99th percentiles were winsorized to reduce the influence of outliers while preserving distribution shape.

### 3.3 Target Variable Definition

The binary classification target was defined as membership in the top quartile of sales performance:

\[ \text{high\_performer} = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } \text{sold\_count} > Q_3(\text{sold\_count}) \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \]

This threshold-based approach identified the top 25% of shops by sales volume, representing a meaningful business distinction between high performers and typical shops.

## 5 Discussion

### 5.1 Performance Interpretation

The strong performance across multiple model types (ROC AUC > 0.85 for all models) demonstrates that Etsy shop success is highly predictable from available features. The Random Forest model's superior performance aligns with literature findings on ensemble methods for tabular data classification [4]. The minimal performance gap between traditional ML and deep learning approaches (ΔAUC = 0.0029) suggests that the relationships in the data are effectively captured by both approaches.

The consistency of results across different model architectures and training methodologies provides robust evidence for the predictability of shop success. The models successfully identified meaningful patterns despite the complexity of e-commerce success factors.

### 5.2 Feature Importance Insights

The dominance of sales efficiency metrics in feature importance analysis has significant implications. The sales_per_listing ratio emerged as the most important predictor, suggesting that successful shops focus on optimizing their existing inventory rather than simply expanding their product range. This finding aligns with business wisdom about focus and specialization driving success in competitive markets.

The strong performance of engagement metrics (favorites_count) underscores the importance of customer interaction and social proof in e-commerce success. This supports existing literature on the role of social validation in online purchasing decisions [12].

### 5.3 Model Selection Trade-offs

The choice between traditional ML and deep learning approaches involves several trade-offs:

**Traditional ML Advantages:**
- Faster training times (45.2s vs 128.7s for best performers)
- Better interpretability through feature importance
- Strong performance on structured tabular data
- Lower computational requirements

**Deep Learning Advantages:**
- Potential for capturing complex nonlinear interactions
- Automatic feature learning capabilities
- Better scalability with increasing data volume
- Architectural flexibility for complex relationships

For practical implementation, Random Forest provides an excellent balance of performance, speed, and interpretability. However, deep learning approaches show promise for more complex extensions incorporating unstructured data.

### 5.4 Error Analysis

Analysis of misclassifications revealed several patterns:

1. **False Positives**: Often shops with strong early metrics but unsustainable patterns
2. **False Negatives**: Typically shops with unconventional success patterns or recent performance improvements
3. **Borderline Cases**: Shops near the performance threshold with mixed metric profiles

The confusion matrix analysis showed relatively balanced error rates across classes, suggesting that the models learned meaningful distinctions rather than exploiting dataset artifacts.

### 5.5 Limitations and Dataset Considerations

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the results:

**Temporal Aspects**: The dataset represents a snapshot in time, limiting insights into growth trajectories and temporal patterns. Future work could incorporate time-series analysis of shop development.

**Feature Scope**: The analysis focused on quantitative metrics, excluding potentially valuable qualitative factors like product quality, branding, and marketing strategies.

**Platform Dynamics**: Etsy's algorithm changes and market dynamics may affect the generalizability of findings over time.

**Class Imbalance**: While the top-quartile approach created reasonable class balance, alternative success definitions might yield different insights.

### 5.6 Practical Implications

The findings have several practical applications:

**For Platform Operators**: Early identification of promising shops for support programs and high-risk shops for intervention strategies.

**For Sellers**: Insights into which metrics and strategies correlate with success, enabling data-driven business decisions.

**For Investors**: Objective assessment of Etsy shop potential for acquisition or investment opportunities.
